# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

# Project Overview
This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict lung cancer based on various clinical and demographic features. The dataset includes attributes like gender, age, smoking habits, and several other symptoms.

# Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
GENDER: Gender of the patient
AGE: Age of the patient
SMOKING, YELLOW_FINGERS, ANXIETY, PEER_PRESSURE, CHRONIC DISEASE, etc.: Various clinical and demographic features
LUNG_CANCER: Whether the patient has lung cancer (target variable)

# Methodology
The project follows these steps:
Data Loading and Preprocessing;
Data Splitting into Training and Testing sets;
Model Fitting using Logistic Regression;
Model Evaluation;
Feature Selection using Stepwise AIC;
Class Imbalance Handling using ROSE;
Regularization with Lasso;
Cross-Validation;

# Personal Observations and Further Exploration Suggestions for the Lung Cancer Prediction Project:
## Data Loading and Preprocessing
I successfully loaded the dataset and transformed categorical variables into factors. This step was crucial for the correct application of logistic regression. I ensured there were no missing or improperly formatted values, which could impact the model's performance.

## Data Splitting
I split the data into training and test sets, ensuring both sets were representative of the overall dataset. This division is vital for an unbiased evaluation of my model.

## Model Fitting
I fitted a logistic regression model to the training data. I made sure the model converged and the resulting coefficients were interpretable. However, I was cautious about potential overfitting.

## Model Evaluation
The initial model showed high accuracy but lower sensitivity. This indicated a potential issue in correctly identifying positive cases, which is critical in medical diagnostics. I then evaluated the model against standard medical performance thresholds.

## Feature Selection
Using stepwise AIC, I simplified the model by removing less significant features. While this improved model simplicity, I checked to ensure no clinically significant predictors were omitted.

## Class Imbalance Handling
I addressed class imbalance using oversampling. It was crucial to check that the synthetic samples did not introduce bias and that the model's sensitivity improved on this balanced dataset.

## Regularization and Cross-Validation
I attempted Lasso regularization but encountered warnings, indicating potential data issues. After resolving these, I re-applied regularization to improve model generalization. Additionally, I used 10-fold cross-validation to confirm the model's consistency and robustness.

## Further Steps one can take with this dataset:
Alternative Models and Ensemble Methods;
Feature Engineering;
External Validation;
Longitudinal Analysis;
Patient Stratification;
Deep Learning Approaches;
Integration with Clinical Decision Systems

This project has been a comprehensive exercise in applying machine learning to a critical healthcare domain. The potential to extend and enhance this work is vast, and it could significantly impact patient outcomes if developed and validated carefully.
